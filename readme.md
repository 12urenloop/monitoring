# Monitoring

A monitoring stack that makes use of grafana for visualizations.

It also contains prometheus as option to collect metrics and serve them to grafana.
It should be invested if this is usefull and if we don't want to use an http api instead.

## Requirements

- docker-compose

## Usage

```
docker-compose up
```
